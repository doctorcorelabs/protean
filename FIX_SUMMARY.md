# Fix Summary - API Connection Issue

## Problem
The 3D Structure Analysis section box was showing error:
```
[vite] http proxy error: /api/gemini/3dviewer
AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
API request failed: 500
```

## Root Cause
1. **Development Mode**: Vite proxy was trying to connect to `http://localhost:8787` (local Cloudflare Worker), but the worker wasn't running
2. **Configuration Issue**: No fallback mechanism when API is unavailable
3. **User Experience**: No clear error message or guidance

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Vite Config Enhancement (`vite.config.ts`)
- Added support for `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
- Added proxy error handling with helpful console messages
- Improved fallback to deployed worker if local worker is not available

### 2. ✅ Improved Error Handling (`geminiService.ts`)
- Added health check before making API calls
- Better error messages with troubleshooting tips
- User-friendly fallback response when API is unavailable
- Shows instructions to start local worker if needed

### 3. ✅ Environment Configuration (`.env`)
- Default configuration uses deployed Cloudflare Worker
- Clear comments explaining both options:
  - Option 1: Use deployed worker (default, no setup needed)
  - Option 2: Use local worker (for development)
- Enabled debug mode for better error visibility

### 4. ✅ Netlify Deployment Config (`netlify.toml`)
- Updated redirects to point to correct worker URL
- Added proper headers for proxy requests

### 5. ✅ Development Scripts (`package.json`)
- Added `dev:setup` - Interactive setup helper
- Added `dev:full` - Start both worker and frontend
- Added `deploy:full` - Deploy both worker and frontend
- Added `check:api` - Verify API health

### 6. ✅ Helper Script (`scripts/dev.ps1`)
- Interactive PowerShell script for Windows
- Guides user through setup process
- Auto-detects configuration issues

### 7. ✅ Documentation
- Created `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Updated `README.md` - Clear installation instructions
- Added common issues and solutions

## How It Works Now

### Default Behavior (No Setup Required)
1. User runs `npm run dev`
2. Frontend connects to deployed Cloudflare Worker
3. All API calls work immediately
4. No local worker setup needed

### For Backend Development
1. User runs `npm run worker:dev` in separate terminal
2. Update `.env` to use `http://localhost:8787`
3. Restart frontend with `npm run dev`
4. Both frontend and backend run locally

### Error Handling
1. Frontend checks API health before making requests
2. If API is unavailable:
   - Shows user-friendly error message
   - Displays instructions to start worker
   - Falls back to sample response
3. No more cryptic ECONNREFUSED errors

## Testing

### API Health Check
```bash
# Test deployed worker
curl https://ai-molecular-research.daivanfebrijuansetiya.workers.dev/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-08T14:18:12.127Z"}
```

### Development Server
```bash
# Start frontend
npm run dev

# Frontend should now:
# 1. Connect to deployed worker successfully
# 2. Show proper error messages if worker is down
# 3. Display fallback responses when needed
```

## Files Modified

1. `vite.config.ts` - Enhanced proxy configuration
2. `src/services/geminiService.ts` - Better error handling
3. `.env` - Updated with clear configuration
4. `netlify.toml` - Fixed production redirects
5. `package.json` - Added helper scripts
6. `README.md` - Updated installation guide
7. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - New troubleshooting guide
8. `scripts/dev.ps1` - New helper script

## Result

✅ **No more ECONNREFUSED errors**
✅ **Clear error messages with solutions**
✅ **Works out of the box with deployed worker**
✅ **Easy local development setup**
✅ **Comprehensive documentation**

## Next Steps for Users

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Everything works immediately with deployed worker!

### For Development
```bash
npm run dev:setup
```
Follow the interactive guide.

## Technical Notes

### Why This Approach?
1. **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately without setup
2. **Flexible**: Easy to switch to local development
3. **Resilient**: Graceful fallback when API is unavailable
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages and guidance

### Architecture
```
Frontend (Vite) → Proxy → Cloudflare Worker → Gemini API
                    ↓
                Fallback Response (if worker unavailable)
```

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_API_URL` - Worker URL (deployed by default)
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Optional override in code
- Development uses `.env` file
- Production uses Netlify environment variables

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and Tested
**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Verified**: API connection working, error handling functional
